  Steps: 
  1) Create the Parent Div
  2) Create the CSS for the Parent Div
  3) set the display: grid; then set the grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows to determine what grid you want
  4) Then go back to the Parent Div and start adding DIVs inside. 
  5) then go back to the CSS and add column-gap and row-gap

<!-- DIFFERENCE between display: inlineblock & display: grid
1) DIVs with inline-block have a "natural" space between them; while DIVs with grid do not.
2) DIVs with inline-block have different vertical alignment; while DIVs with grid have same vertical alignment. 

1) and 2) has been verified.

  1fr = div takes up the rest of the free space to its right in its container or web page
  1fr 1fr 
  1fr 2fr = the first div will have 1/3 of the free space, and the second div will have 2/3 of the free space

<!--There are three columns. Each column = 1fr. 
  Set the width of the video thumbnail to 100%, so that the width =
100% of the column width.-->
